# Criteria for adding events


* **Tech focus**<br>
This list ought to be a list of *tech* events *(for now)*, so please only list events that focus on tech topics. So, anything concerning IT, hacking, engineering etc. is a go.

* **"Relevance"**<br>
This one is a bit trickier. There is no hard and fast rule what makes an event relevant enough to get added to the list; however, if every little local user group or meet-up were added, this list would quickly get very huge and a pain to skim through.<br>
The size of an event as well as its frequency are good indicators (one might argue that the bigger an event, the more in need of a Code of Conduct it is). The same might be said about if one has to register (or even buy a ticket) for the event in advance or if it's  more of a drop-in get-together for a comparatively small group of like-minded people.<br><br>
Some questions that might help you identify how suitable an event is:
    * Is it an event which is deemed "important" enough to travel to by people from out-of-state or even abroad?
    * Does the event have dedicated speakers, panels, workshops etc.?
    * Does it get advertised or covered by local media or tech publications, thereby gaining wider recognition (outside of a circle of insiders)? etc.<br>

* **Event series**<br>
Local chapters of international event series should not get listed separately if their Code of Conduct situation is the same as that of the majority of events in the series. However, do feel free to list such events if their Conduct Policy differs from (most of) the rest of the events. (This applies to local instances of Rails Girls or PyLadies workshops, for example.)

* **Non-English-speaking events**<br>
One of the purposes of this list is to help you find out about conduct policies of local events, so of course events where (only) the local language is spoken can -- and should -- also get included. However, as this list should also serve as an international reference sheet, it is only polite to let potential visitors or speakers know if an event's (main) language is not English. If this is the case for an event you would like to list because it fulfills all other criteria, please add: (Language: TheParticularLanguage) or (Languages: MainLanguage, SecondaryLanguage) to its description.
