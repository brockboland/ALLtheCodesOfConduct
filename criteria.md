# Criteria for adding events, event template and examples


## Criteria for adding events

* **Tech focus**<br>
This list ought to be a list of *tech* events *(for now)*, so please only list events that focus on tech topics. So, anything concerning IT, hacking, engineering etc. is a go.

* **"Relevance"**<br>
This one is a bit trickier. There is no hard and fast rule what makes an event relevant enough to get added to the list; however, if every little local user group or meet-up were added, this list would quickly get very huge and a pain to skim through.<br>
The size of an event as well as its frequency are good indicators (one might argue that the bigger an event, the more in need of a Code of Conduct it is). The same might be said about if one has to register (or even buy a ticket) for the event in advance or if it's  more of a drop-in get-together for a comparatively small group of like-minded people.<br><br>
Some questions that might help you identify how suitable an event is:
    * Is it an event which is deemed "important" enough to travel to by people from out-of-state or even abroad?
    * Does the event have dedicated speakers, panels, workshops etc.?
    * Does it get advertised or covered by local media or tech publications, thereby gaining wider recognition (outside of a circle of insiders)? etc.<br>

* **Event series**<br>
Local chapters of international event series should not get listed separately if their Code of Conduct situation is the same as that of the majority of events in the series. However, do feel free to list such events if their Conduct Policy differs from (most of) the rest of the events. (This applies to local instances of Rails Girls or PyLadies workshops, for example.)

* **Non-English-speaking events**<br>
One of the purposes of this list is to help you find out about conduct policies of local events, so of course events where (only) the local language is spoken can -- and should -- also get included. However, as this list should also serve as an international reference sheet, it is only polite to let potential visitors or speakers know if an event's (main) language is not English. If this is the case for an event you would like to list because it fulfills all other criteria, please add: (Language: TheParticularLanguage) or (Languages: MainLanguage, SecondaryLanguage) to its description.


## Template

* **[EventName](http://website.com/)** [[t]](https://twitter.com/eventtwitter) [[f]](https://facebook.com/eventfacebook) [[g]](https://plus.google.com/eventgoogleplus), Country, (State,) City - **Y** **N** *P*<br>
YYYY, FullNameOfMonth, D(-D)<br>
~~YYYY, FullNameOfMonth, D(-D)~~ *(strike-through for past events)*<br>
Short description of event or mention of topics. (Language: IfNonEnglishLanguage)<br>
[TitleOfParticularCodeOfConduct](http://website.com/codeofconduct)<br> 
**Notes:** notes for events with "partial" Codes of Conduct (*P*) go here.

### Notes on the event template

Every event listing starts with the event's name, which should get linked to the event's official website. If it is a recurring event that uses different URLs for each instance, either link to the main website (if there is one) or to the website of the event's current or last instance.

If there are official Twitter, Facebook or Google+ accounts for the event, it would be great if you linked to those as well to make it easier for other users of the list to keep up with or get in touch with the event. (The [g] stands for Google+, not GitHub, as this is about Social Media listings for events.) It is fine to include only one or two Social Media links, though Twitter should be given precedence over Facebook or Google+.

The name and potential Social Media links should get followed by the country and city the event takes place in/at. If the city's name is ambiguous (as will be the case with events in the United States), please also include the state.

Add the appropriate flag for the existence of a Code of Conduct for the event. (**Y** for yes, **N** for no, *P* for "partial". Partial might be used for events that e.g. state expected behaviour but don't provide any clear-cut information on what constitutes misconduct or how harrassment will be dealt with. It might also be used for events whose conduct policies only seem to have been added as an afterthought, or events which seem to make light of the topic.)

The next line should contain the event's date in the format YYYY, FullNameOfMonth, D(-D). If the event spreads over more than one month, list the names of the months first, and the days later, e.g. 2014, February-March, 28-1. If an event has already taken place, use ~'s to strike-through the date.

Next comes a brief description of the event. This could be taken from the event's website or put together by yourself, just make sure it is accurate and communicates what the event is about in not more than one or two sentences (keep in mind that not all official event taglines are good at communicating what an event is about). If the event is held in another language than English, or if it's a mixed-language event, add the language(s) spoken right after the event's description, like so: (Language: German) or (Languages: German, English), with all official languages ordered by the preference or space they are given. (Meaning if most talks are in English but some are in German, the order should be English, German, not the other way around.)

After the event's description comes the name of its conduct policy (if applicable), which should link to the page, or section on the event's website, where the policy can be found.

Finally, use notes for events that have a "partial" Code of Conduct to briefly explain the *P*-rating. For events with a definitive **N** or **Y**, notes are normally not needed and can be left off.

### Event aliases
For events that use numbers or aliases to refer to particular instances -- e.g. HOPE X for the tenth edition of HOPE, or 30C3 for the 30th occurence of the CCC's Chaos Communication Congress etc. -- use the event's base name (in this case: HOPE and Chaos Communication Congress) for adding the event to the list. Additionally, you can add a separate entry for the current alias to refer back to the base name (see examples).


#### Abbreviations
Please do not forget to mention the full name of events even if they are commonly abbreviated. In some cases, it might make sense to mention an event's full name first followed by its abbreviation (e.g. Chaos Communication Congress - CCC, as both full name and abbreviation are used but CCC is also the abbreviation for the club organising this and other events, which might lead to confusion), in others, the opposite might be preferable (e.g. HOPE - Hackers On Planet Earth, as people usually refer to or know the conference by its abbreviation rather than its full name).
