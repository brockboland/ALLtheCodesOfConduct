## Tech events with (and without) a Code of Conduct

I have given the idea of Codes of Conduct and why having them in place at conferences, congresses and other events might be a good thing quite a bit of thought over the past months.

I really like the concept of **Safe Spaces**, and while an anti-harrassment policy does not automatically make an event a Safe Space, I appreciate event organisers trying to make all attendees feel equally comfortable. This does not mean that an event without a Code of Conduct cannot be inclusive -- of course it can. The difference is that I will have a harder time estimating beforehand how considerate its organisers seem to be.

More and more tech events (= the kind of events I am most interested in) are putting Codes of Conduct in place, but it is difficult to keep track of them all. Existing listings of such events that I found online, like [this list](http://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/conference-policies/)  of conferences with anti-harassment policies on the Ada Initiative's website, for example, are either outdated or do not include any of the (smaller) local events I am interested in (or both), and they cannot be edited by people like me either.

This is why I wanted to start my own collection of tech events with (and without!) a Code of Conduct, which can be contributed to by other members of the community.

You can find the list itself [here](https://github.com/kerstin/ALLtheCodeOfConducts/blob/master/EVENTS.md) and the criteria for events to be included [here](https://github.com/kerstin/ALLtheCodeOfConducts/blob/master/criteria.md). For now it is really just a simple, alphabetical list, though it would probably make sense to make this into something bigger -- sorting by country/geographical region, date or conference topic comes to mind.

If you have an idea on how to build upon this first, very basic list or would like to help, please let me know by opening an issue.
